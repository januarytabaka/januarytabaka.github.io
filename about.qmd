## Welcome to AI Scratchpad

Thank you for visiting! In the rapidly evolving world of AI, theory is everywhere, but practical, hands-on understanding is what truly matters. This blog is my **AI Scratchpad**â€”a public notebook where I learn by doing.

My goal is to demystify the complex and cut through the hype by building, testing, and exploring real-world AI and Machine Learning concepts.

This blog is my commitment to learning in public. I hope my experiments and findings are as useful to you as they are to me.

### About Me

My name is January Tabaka. I created this project to document my learning and connect with others who are on a similar path.

Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn or follow my work on GitHub!
