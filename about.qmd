My name is January Tabaka. I started out as a coder years ago, eventually found my way into databases, and from there, I dove headfirst into the world of data. AI Scratchpad is my way of documenting what I learn and connecting with others on a similar journey.

Please feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn!
