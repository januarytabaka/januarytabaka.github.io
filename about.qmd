## Welcome to AI Scratchpad

Thank you for visiting! In the rapidly evolving world of AI, theory is everywhere, but practical, hands-on understanding is what truly matters. This blog is my **AI Scratchpad**â€”a public notebook where I learn by doing.

My goal is to demystify the complex and cut through the hype by building, testing, and exploring real-world AI and Machine Learning concepts.

### What You'll Find Here

This is a place for practical exploration. You can expect content like:

*   **Step-by-Step Tutorials:** From fundamental machine learning models to fine-tuning the latest Large Language Models (LLMs).
*   **A Bilingual Approach:** As a data scientist fluent in both R and Python, I'll often tackle problems using both ecosystems, showing the unique strengths of each tool for the job.
*   **Tool & Tech Deep Dives:** Exploring everything from ML in the database (like Oracle SQL) to new libraries that make our lives easier.
*   **Real-World Projects:** Documenting the process of building small, end-to-end AI applications from scratch.

This blog is my commitment to learning in public. I hope my experiments and findings are as useful to you as they are to me.

### About Me

My name is January Tabaka. I created this project to document my learning and connect with others who are on a similar path.
