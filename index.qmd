Welcome to the AI Scratchpad! This blog is my public notebook for demystifying the world of AI and Machine Learning. Here, I learn by doingâ€”building models, testing tools, and documenting the entire process. My goal is to create practical, hands-on guides that cut through the hype. My focus is always on finding the clearest path to a working solution. I hope what I learn is as useful to you as it is to me.
