Welcome to the privacy policy for AI Scratchpad. Your privacy is important to me, and this document explains what data is collected and how it is used. My goal is to be as transparent as possible while respecting your privacy.

### The TL;DR

*   I use a self-hosted, privacy-focused analytics platform (Matomo).
*   I do **not** use tracking cookies.
*   I have **anonymized** all IP addresses.
*   The data I collect is used only to understand my audience and improve my content. It is never sold or shared with third parties.

### Analytics

This website uses Matomo, a self-hosted analytics platform. Unlike Google Analytics, this means that all data collected is stored on my own private server and is not shared with any other company.

The following information is collected for basic analytics:

*   **Anonymized IP Address:** Your IP address is anonymized by masking the last two bytes (e.g., `192.168.x.x`) before it is stored. This allows for general geographic location detection (country/city) without storing your personal IP.
*   **Technical Information:** Your browser type, operating system, and screen resolution.
*   **Usage Information:** The pages you visit on this site, the time of your visit, and the referring website.

This data is used solely to help me understand what content is popular and how to improve the website.

### Cookies

This website is configured to be **cookieless**. No analytics cookies are stored on your browser.

### Comments (Giscus)

The comment system on this blog is powered by [Giscus](https://giscus.app/), which uses GitHub Discussions. If you choose to leave a comment, you will be required to authorize the Giscus app and log in via your GitHub account.

The content of your comment and your GitHub profile information will be publicly visible and are governed by GitHub's privacy policy.

### Your Rights (GDPR)

If you are a resident of the European Economic Area (EEA), you have certain data protection rights. I am the data controller for this website. If you have any questions or wish to exercise your rights, please contact me.
